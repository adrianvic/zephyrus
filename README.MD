# Zephyrus
Zephyrus is a *VERY* simple HTTP(S) webserver written in TypeScript. Take a look on our [wiki](https://git.disroot.org/adrianvictor/zephyrus/wiki) for setup instructions.

## Main features
- HTTPS support.
- Directory listing with custom CSS (with a trick you should also be able to use custom JS).
- Default page when accessing root.
- Automatic MIME type detection.

## Disclaimer
This is maintained by a computing student (and as the year I'm writing this, I'm in my first year), I have no knowledge to provide something secure, I will work to improve my skills, but there's no guarantee I'll won't let something obvious pass. DO NOT RUN ZEPHYRUS AS ROOT.
